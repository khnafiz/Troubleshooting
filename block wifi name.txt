
******* How to allow, hide or block neighbor’s WiFi Networks on Windows Computers *******

Note: open the Command Prompt with administrator privilege

1. Block neighbor’s WiFi Networks on Windows

	netsh wlan add filter permission=block ssid="Wireless Network Name" networktype=infrastructure
	
2. Remove a blocked WiFi network

	 netsh wlan delete filter permission=block ssid="Wireless Network Name" networktype=infrastructure

3. How to allow a WiFi network

	netsh wlan add filter permission=allow ssid="Wireless Network Name" networktype=infrastructure

   To hide all the networks except the allowed network, execute this command-

	netsh wlan add filter permission=denyall networktype=infrastructure

   If you want to remove the “deny all” filter or you want to remove all the network names from the blocklist, the following command will do the job

	netsh wlan delete filter permission=denyall networktype=infrastructure

5. Check all the filters

	netsh wlan show filters

6. Disadvantage of using these commands

   The only disadvantage of using these commands is it doesn’t block the actual Wi-Fi router. It does block or allows the wireless network name. 
 
   That implies that if you change the WiFi name, you will be able to overwrite the filter.
